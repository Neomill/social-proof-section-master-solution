## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size.
- Starting with mobile-first design approach makes me uncomfortable.
- With my small knowledge about css position, this project acquire some time to finish.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
- I learn how to design mobile-first approach and it's advantages.

- When choosing between css grid and css flex, thought both of this property is capable on achieving any display property, considering if you have 2dimension display then use a grid, but if you only need a single row for display then use flex instead.

- With display flex: if gap property has been set, it is keep even the flex-direction has 
been change.

- by default, if an element is set to display flex everything is stretch to the same height, all the height of the children elements will be set to element with that has a largest height, in short if the largest height of the element within a flex element is 80px, all of the children elements will have 80px height.

### Continued development

With this project I discover mobile-first approach which makes me interested on it, I would love to further my knowledge on this topic and apply it on my future projects.

Since I was not comfortable with CSS Grid, I will also further my knowledge in this topic.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the CSS King Kevin Powell for his outstanding video about this project. He made a video on youtube which he explained very well on what is the fastest and nearest approach on building this project. Without his video I think the time spent on this project would be double if I myself would only do this project.
